# Data Cleaning with SQL Queries Portfolio Project

## Description
This portfolio project demonstrates data cleaning techniques using SQL queries applied to the Nashville Housing dataset. The project focuses on standardizing date formats, populating missing property addresses, breaking down address columns into individual components, standardizing categorical values, and removing duplicate records and unused columns.

## Skills Utilized

Standardizing Date Formats

Populating Missing Data

Data Transformation (Breaking Down Address Columns)

Standardizing Categorical Values

Removing Duplicate Records

Dropping Unused Columns

SQL Queries Overview

The project comprises various SQL queries categorized based on the data cleaning tasks performed:

**Standardizing Date Formats:**
Convert the SaleDate column to a DATE datatype and standardize the date format.

**Populating Missing Property Addresses:**
Identify and populate missing property addresses by leveraging matching ParcelID values.

**Breaking Out Address into Individual Columns:** 
Split the PropertyAddress column into separate Address, City, and State columns for better analysis.

**Standardizing Categorical Values:**
Standardize categorical values in the SoldAsVacant column to 'Yes' or 'No'.

**Removing Duplicate Records:**
Identify and remove duplicate records based on specific criteria using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

**Deleting Unused Columns:**
Remove unused columns from the dataset to streamline data storage and improve query performance.

## Instructions

To explore the SQL portfolio project:
